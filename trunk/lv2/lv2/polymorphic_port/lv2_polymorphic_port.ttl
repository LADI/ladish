    rdfs:comment    """
Ports of this type contain a struct of type LV2_Polymorphic_Buffer,
defined in <lv2_polymorphic_ports.h>.  These ports contain a pointer
and a uint32_t type field which is a URI mapped to an integer (using the
LV2 URI Map extension) which describes the type of data pointed to.

Hosts MUST obey the following rules in order to instantiate a plugin
with polymorphic ports:

  * When connecting polymorphic ports to buffers, the type field of that
    buffer MUST be set appropriately.  The type field of a buffer MUST NOT
    be changed at any other time (i.e. if the type is changed, connect_port
    must be called to notify the port of the change).

  * When connecting output polymorphic ports, the type field MAY be set
    to 0 to indicate the plugin may produce any (supported) type based
    on the types of it's inputs.  The plugin MUST then set the type field
    to the type it has chosen.  Otherwise, the type field MUST be set to
    the host expects to receive from the plugin.  If a port is :generic
    but a plugin cannot produce the requested output type, the plugin
    MUST set the type field to 0.  The host MUST check for this situation
    when connecting any :generic port to a buffer with a type not explicitly
    listed as supported by the port with :supportsType.
