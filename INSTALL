===================================================

Requirements (tools, headers and libraries):

 * You need gcc for C and C++ (4.2.2 should work)
 * You need JACK (1.9.5 should work)
 * You need dbus (1.2.16 should work)
 * You need libuuid from e2fsprogs (1.40.2 should work)
 * You need the expat XML parser (2.0.1 should work)
 * Python (for ladish_control and LADI Tools)

For building the GTK2 frontend gladish (disabled by default),
additional dependencies are:

 * You need glib-2.20.3 or later
 * You need dbus-glib-0.74 or later
 * You need gtk+-2.20.0 or later

Note, gladish will not work with GTK3 (or GTK4).
The Claudia frontend is alternative GUI in python that uses Qt.

===================================================

= Configure it =

./waf configure

This will configure for installation to /usr/local prefix.
If you want to use other prefix, use --prefix option:

./waf configure --prefix=/usr

If you want to build gladish as well:

./waf configure --prefix=/usr --enable-gladish

For full list of options, run:

./waf configure --help

= Build it =

./waf

By default, all available CPUs/cores will be used.
To adjust the number, use -j option, e.g. for 4 jobs:

./waf -j 4

= Install it =

./waf install

You probably want to run later as superuser to install system-wide
